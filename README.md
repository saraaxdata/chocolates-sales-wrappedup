## 📖 Project Overview
Chocolate Sales Analytics is a Power BI dashboard built to replace manual Excel reporting with fast, reliable, decision-ready insights across sales, profit, products, people, and regions.

What used to take 2+ hours every week now takes under 5 minutes, while surfacing actionable opportunities that directly improved profitability.

## 💼 Business Problem
The sales team spent 2+ hours onmultiple Excel files to track revenue, products, and regional performance. Reporting required manual consolidation each week, making it slow, error-prone, and reactive.

As a result:
* Sales and profit were visible, but profitability by product was unclear
* High-revenue products were incorrectly assumed to be high-margin
* Regional performance issues surfaced late or not at all
* Identifying top sales performers required manual effort
* Leadership lacked a single, trusted source of truth

Decisions were based on partial insight instead of real-time data.
